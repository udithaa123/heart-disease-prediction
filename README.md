## ðŸš€ Description  
This notebook implements a pipeline for â€¦ (briefly state what the notebook does: e.g., ingestion of documents, indexing, query interface, semantic retrieval, etc.).  
It is designed to run in Google Colab, enabling easy experimentation, prototyping and sharing.

## ðŸ§© Features  
- Document ingestion from various sources (e.g., CSV, PDFs, web)  
- Pre-processing: tokenization, embedding generation, filtering  
- Semantic search functionality using embeddings (e.g., via a vector store)  
- Interactive query interface (in notebook cells)  
- Visualization or result inspection (optional)  
- Easy to rerun and extend for your own dataset  

## ðŸŽ¯ Intended Users  
- Researchers or students interested in information retrieval and semantic search  
- Developers prototyping knowledge search tools  
- Anyone wanting a working example of embedding-based retrieval in Colab  

## ðŸ“‹ Prerequisites  
- A Google account with access to Colab  
- Optional: Some compute resource (if using GPU/TPU)  
- Internet connection (for installing dependencies and downloading any external models/data)  
- Basic knowledge of Python, Jupyter/Colab and libraries such as `numpy`, `pandas`, `transformers` (or whichever you use)  

## ðŸ”§ Setup & Running  
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab:
